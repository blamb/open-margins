# Open Margins

**Open Margins** is a suite of AI-assisted tools for open educational resource (OER) pedagogy, developed at [TRU Open Press](https://openpress.trubox.ca). Each tool pairs a different reading or design practice with Claude AI, running entirely in the browser with a lightweight local proxy server.

**Works with any OER content.** The TRU Open Press catalogue is the featured collection and loads directly from the built-in book browser, but every tool also accepts a **URL** (any open web page), a **PDF or .docx upload**, or **pasted text** — so you can bring any openly licensed material you're already working with.

## Tools

### 📖 Companion
An AI-assisted reading companion for OER texts. Browse the TRU Open Press catalogue, fetch any open URL, upload a PDF or .docx, or paste text directly — then select a passage and ask Claude to *illuminate*, *interrogate*, or *connect* it to other ideas. Annotations accumulate in the margin as you read. Includes a full **voice reader** (Web Speech API) with sentence-by-sentence highlighting, speed control, and voice selection.

### ⬡ Nova
An experimental concept-map explorer for OER texts. Browse the TRU Open Press catalogue, fetch a URL, upload a file, or paste text — and Nova generates an interactive concept map showing key ideas and their relationships. Designed for exploratory, non-linear engagement with any open content.

### 🌿 Rhizo
A rhizomatic learning activity builder grounded in [Dave Cormier's](https://davecormier.com) work on rhizomatic education and his book *The Rhizome and the Good Learning Life*. Generates activities around key concepts — Trust Audit, Abundance Check, Breadcrumb Trail — and surfaces rotating quotes from Cormier's writing.

### 🌲 Sylva
A lesson design tool grounded in [TRU's Open Learning Design Framework](https://designframework.trubox.ca) (Caring, Connected, Active, Open). Load any OER content via the TRU catalogue, a URL, file upload, or paste — then generate Bloom's-tagged learning objectives, timed lesson arcs with five segment types (Hook, Direct, Active, Community, Synthesis), and constructive alignment assessment suggestions.

### 🔧 Activity Builder
A standalone tool for generating H5P-style interactive activities from OER content. Paste a passage, upload a file, or pull from any open URL — and generate drag-and-drop, matching, or scenario-based activities ready for Moodle.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser (Chrome recommended for voice reader)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v18 or higher)
- An [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com)

## Setup

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/blamb/open-margins.git
cd open-margins
```

**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

**3. Set your API key**
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
```

**4. Start the server**
```bash
node server.js
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

Each tool also has its own server if you want to run them independently:

| Tool | Directory | Default port |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| Companion | `companion/` | 3001 |
| Nova | `nova/` | 3002 |
| Rhizo | `rhizo/` | 3003 |

To run a tool individually:
```bash
cd companion
node server.js
```

## Design Principles

Open Margins is built on the [TRU Open Learning Design Framework](https://designframework.trubox.ca):

- **Caring** — tools include accessibility prompts, wellbeing reminders, and low-stakes entry points
- **Connected** — community and belonging are first-class activity types
- **Active** — every tool centres doing over passive consumption
- **Open** — built on OER, openly licensed, transparent by design
